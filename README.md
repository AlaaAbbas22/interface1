# Food Project

A full-stack web application built entirely with Next.js, utilizing Next.js API routes for backend functionality.

## Directory Structure

```
/
├── client/   # Frontend and backend (Next.js)
```

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Setup

### Application (Next.js)

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```
2. Install the required Node.js packages (force install to resolve dependencies if needed):

   ```bash
   npm install --force
   ```
3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Notes

- The `server` directory is no longer used, as we have migrated backend functionality to Next.js API routes.
